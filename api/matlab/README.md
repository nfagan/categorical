# fcat

`fcat` is the Matlab interface to the cpp `categorical` library. Housed in these subfolders are examples and tests of that interface, as well as additional utilities that simplify working with data alongside `fcat` objects.

The main classdef file is `fcat.m`. `plotlabeled.m` exposes a plotting utility class that can be used to generate meaningfully labeled subplots of data, for a variety of different plot types.

Tested with Matlab >= R2015b; ymmv for earlier releases.
